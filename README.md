# gomcp-tool-notion

Notion tool for the Model Context Protocol

This is a sample MCP server that uses the Notion API to retrieve the content of a Notion page.

The MCP SDK being used is the [MCP Go SDK](https://github.com/llmcontext/gomcp).

# Note

If you also work on the MCP Go SDK, you can add this line to the `go.mod` file to use your local version of the SDK:

```
replace github.com/llmcontext/gomcp v0.1.0 => ../gomcp
```
